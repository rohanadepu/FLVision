# Quickstart Examples
This directory has some simple scripts playing around with different parts of FLoX.
They can be used to learn the package as a whole or to use as a starting point for writing
your own custom FLoX-based scripts!

Note, if you want to run anything in this directory without installing FLoX (i.e., you'e just
cloned the repo to your local machine), then you will need to use `import sys;
sys.path.append("..")` at the top of the script and run it from the `quickstart` directory.
