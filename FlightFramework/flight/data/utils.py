    r"""
    Splits up Datasets across worker nodes in a Topology using Dirichlet distributions
    for IID and non-IID settings.

    It is recommended to use an alpha value of 1.0 for either `samples_alpha` want
    non-IID number of samples across workers. Setting this alpha value to be < 1 will
    result in extreme cases where many workers will have 0 data samples.

    Notes:
        Currently, this function only works with data for classification tasks with a discrete number
        of labels/classes. Do *not* use this function for regression-based data. Also, this function assumes
        ``data`` is naturally iid.

    Args:
        data (Dataset): The original centralized data object that needs to be split into subsets.
        topo (Topology): The network to split data across.
        num_classes (int): Number of classes available in ``data``.
        samples_alpha (float): The $\alpha>0$ parameter under the Dirichlet distribution for *the number of
            data samples* each worker node in ``topo`` will have. The number of data samples across all worker
            nodes become increasingly heterogeneous as $\alpha$ gets larger.
        labels_alpha (float): The $\alpha>0$ parameter under the Dirichlet distribution for the class distributions
            across worker nodes in ``topo``. The number of data samples across all worker nodes become increasingly
            heterogeneous as $\alpha$ gets larger.

    Examples:
        >>> from torchvision.datasets import MNIST
        >>> topo = Topology.from_yaml("my_topo.yml")
        >>> data = MNIST()
        >>> subsets = federated_split(data, topo, num_classes=10, samples_alpha=1., labels_alpha=1.)
        >>> next(iter(subsets.items()))
        >>> # (NodeID(1), Subset(...)) # TODO: Run a real example and paste it here.

    Returns:
        A federated version of the dataset that is split up statistically based on the arguments alpha arguments.
