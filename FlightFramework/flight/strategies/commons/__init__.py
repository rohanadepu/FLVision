"""
Provides common, basic methods that serve as "building blocks" for making strategies_depr more easily.
This is because there is often much overlap in terms of the functionality a `Strategy`
will use for one of its callbacks. This just helps make code more reusable and simplify
the process of kick-starting research efforts into defining novel Strategies.
